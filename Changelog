Changes in 0.1.6:

Rename several team logo files that had a colon (:)
in the filename, as Windows doesn't like colons
in filenames.

Update the Policy that controls the scoreboard.html
Intermission Name (text description) to include
"unconfirmed" and "confirmed" text, specifically to
address the issue of "Final" being displayed after the
bout.  Now by default, "Unofficial Final" is displayed,
and the operator must manually select "confirmed" after
the score is confirmed to change the display to "Final".
The actual text is controllable in the Policy control
area.

Update the Policy that controls the scoreboard.html
Intermission Time to hide it by default after the
bout is over.  The operator can show the time manually,
or disable the paramter to hide it by default after
Period 2 is over.

Add red background to each team's LeadJammer control
in one-operator.html, to give visual feedback to operator
of lead jammer status.

Add Policy to display elapsed Period time (as well as normal
Period time) in one-operator.html, only in edit mode.
Includes ability to manually change the Period clock using
elapsed time instead of normal time.

Update <select> drop-down boxes so sub-elements can be used as
each <option> element's text.  So for example, the operator
jammer list displays Skater Names by default, but can be
changed to display Jammer Numbers instead.  For this example,
in the <select> element's class string, change
OptionTextElement:Name to OptionTextElement:Number

Fix bug where Team 1's "Lead" and "No Lead" Jammer key
assignments were reversed.

Fix bug that hid the Timeout controls on the iPhone.

Change one-operator.html clock column widths.

Add control to change Countdown clock maximum time.

Update save.html and corresponding java core code
to support loading specifically-formatted XML
files with a single Team element and list
of Skaters, to load into either Team 1 or 2.

Add Policy to control scoreboard.html always
showing Jam number during Lineups and Timeouts.
Defaults to off, which is previous behavior.

Add auto-font-resizing to Countdown view,
so Countdown times larger than 59 seconds
will correctly display.

Fix bug in Countdown clock not showing on Countdown view.

Fix bug in ScoreBoardFromXmlFile, in end-of-load parsing.

Fix bug in ScoreBoardEventXmlVisitor, handling the "remove"
and "add" attributes.
