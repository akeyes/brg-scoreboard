h1. Roller Derby Scoreboard for the Brandywine Roller Girls

This is the "Brandywine Roller Girls'":http://brandywinerollergirls.com copy of the wonderful crg-scoreboard platform found at Sourceforge:
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/derbyscoreboard/":http://sourceforge.net/projects/derbyscoreboard/

This code is here so it can be shared by the team as we put art in, build XML team lists, and generally prepare to use it for bouts.

If you are looking for the software for your own team, you should not use the stuff here (though you are welcome to), but rather the code at the Sourceforge link, which is likely newer.

h1. How to start the server

Make sure you have Java installed, then run the script corresponding to your OS:
* *For OSX:* $ ./start-MacOS.command
* *For Linux:* ./start-Linux.sh
* *For Windows:* ./start-Windows.bat

Then, point a browser to:
http://localhost:8000 or
