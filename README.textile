h1. Roller Derby Scoreboard for the Brandywine Roller Girls

This is a single league's copy of the wonderful crg-scoreboard platform found at Sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/derbyscoreboard/

If you found this page via a google search or otherwise, you should use the link above to find the main project.

I'm putting this code here so it can be shared and used by the members of the Brandywine Roller Girls as we put art in, build XML team lists, etc.

h1. How to start the server

Make sure you have Java installed, then run the script corresponding to your OS:
* *For OSX:* $ ./start-MacOS.command
* *For Linux:* ./start-Linux.sh
* *For Windows:* ./start-Windows.bat

Then, point a browser to:
http://localhost:8000 or
http://127.0.0.1:8000 for further instructions.
